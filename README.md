# Individuality in Kilobots
The codes we used for our ALife23 paper: "Inidividuality in Swarm Robots with the Case Study of Kilobots: Noise, Bug, or Feature?".
The repo includes the implementation of inter-individual variations in heading bias of Kilobots simulated in ARGoS. 

Based on the main repository of Kilobot simulator in ARGoS developed by Carlo Pinciroli: https://github.com/ilpincy/argos3-kilobot
