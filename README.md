# Individuality in Kilobots
The codes we used for our ALife23 paper: "Inidividuality in Swarm Robots with the Case Study of Kilobots: Noise, Bug, or Feature?".
The repo includes the implementation of inter-individual variations in heading bias of Kilobots simulated in ARGoS. 

Based on the main repository of Kilobot simulator in ARGoS developed by Carlo Pinciroli: https://github.com/ilpincy/argos3-kilobot


- [ ] Update the bash files
- [ ] Add the post-pro files
    - [ ]  for simulation
    - [ ]  for real robot experiments
- [ ] Add the TeX project
- [ ] Add real robot codes for phototaxis in a separate folder
